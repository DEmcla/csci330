# CSCI330 Catch-Up Assignment: Chapters 2-5 Essentials

## 📋 Purpose

This condensed assignment helps students who have fallen behind get back on track. Instead of redoing every missed Chapter 2-5 assignment in full, it covers the **essential concepts** from those four chapters in one focused program per chapter. It is worth **50 points** of credit recovery; see Canvas for how the recovered credit is applied to your grade.

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

**Worth**: 50 points of credit recovery (see Canvas for how it applies to your grade)
**Time Estimate**: 4 hours total (1 hour per chapter)
**Due Date**: [TBD -- see Canvas for summer date]

**Requirements**: Complete ONE focused program per chapter demonstrating core concepts

---

## ✅ What You Need to Do

### Chapter 2: Types and Memory (12.5 points)
**Program**: `types_essentials.cpp`
**Time**: 60 minutes

Create a program that demonstrates:

1. **Fundamental Types** (4 points)
   - Declare and use int, double, char, bool
   - Use `sizeof()` to show type sizes
   - Display range limits using `<climits>` (INT_MAX, INT_MIN, etc.)

2. **Type Conversions** (4 points)
   - Show implicit conversion (int to double)
   - Demonstrate explicit casting with `static_cast<>`
   - Show information loss in narrowing conversions (double to int)

3. **Arrays and Basic Memory** (4.5 points)
   - Create an array of at least 5 integers
   - Access elements safely with bounds checking
   - Calculate array statistics (sum, average, max)
   - Use pointer arithmetic to iterate through array

**Example Output**:
```
=== Type System Basics ===
int: 4 bytes, range: -2147483648 to 2147483647
double: 8 bytes, value: 3.14159

=== Type Conversions ===
double(3.14159) -> int: 3 (precision lost!)
int(42) -> double: 42.000000

=== Array Operations ===
Array: [85, 92, 78, 88, 95]
Sum: 438, Average: 87.6, Max: 95
```

---

### Chapter 3: References (12.5 points)
**Program**: `references_essentials.cpp`
**Time**: 60 minutes

Create a program that demonstrates:

1. **Basic References** (4 points)
   - Create a variable and a reference to it
   - Show that modifying through reference changes the original
   - Print addresses to prove they're the same

2. **Const References** (4 points)
   - Write a function taking const reference parameter
   - Show you can read but not modify through const reference
   - Demonstrate efficiency for large structs

3. **Reference Parameters** (4.5 points)
   - Create a struct (e.g., `Student` with name, GPA)
   - Write a function that takes non-const reference and modifies it
   - Write a function that takes const reference for read-only access
   - Demonstrate both in main

**Example Output**:
```
=== Basic References ===
Original: 100, Reference: 100
Modified through reference: 200
Addresses match: 0x7fff5fbff8bc == 0x7fff5fbff8bc

=== Student Management ===
Original: Alice, GPA: 3.5
After update: Alice, GPA: 3.8
Is honor student: Yes
```

### Chapter 4: Object Lifecycle (12.5 points)
**Program**: `lifecycle_essentials.cpp`
**Time**: 60 minutes

Create a program that demonstrates:

1. **Constructor Basics** (4 points)
   - Create a class with default constructor and parameterized constructor
   - Add a destructor that prints when object is destroyed
   - Demonstrate multiple constructor overloads
   - Show automatic constructor/destructor calls

2. **RAII Pattern** (4 points)
   - Create a class that manages a resource (e.g., file, array, counter)
   - Acquire resource in constructor
   - Release resource in destructor
   - Demonstrate automatic cleanup even with early returns

3. **Copy Constructor** (4.5 points)
   - Implement copy constructor for your class
   - Show deep copy vs shallow copy behavior
   - Demonstrate when copies are made
   - Add logging to track object creation/destruction

**Example Output**:
```
=== Constructor/Destructor Demo ===
[Constructor] Account #1001 created: $1000.00
[Constructor] Account #1002 created: $2500.00
[Copy Constructor] Creating copy of Account #1001
[Destructor] Account #1002 destroyed
[Destructor] Account #1001 (copy) destroyed
[Destructor] Account #1001 destroyed

Summary: 3 objects created, 3 objects destroyed
```

### Chapter 5: Runtime Polymorphism (12.5 points)
**Program**: `polymorphism_essentials.cpp`
**Time**: 60 minutes

Create a program that demonstrates:

1. **Basic Inheritance and Virtual Functions** (4 points)
   - Create abstract base class `Shape` with pure virtual functions
   - Implement at least 2 derived classes (e.g., `Circle`, `Rectangle`)
   - Use `virtual` keyword correctly
   - Include virtual destructor

2. **Polymorphic Behavior** (4 points)
   - Create array/vector of base class pointers
   - Store different derived types in the collection
   - Call virtual functions through base pointers
   - Demonstrate polymorphic behavior

3. **Practical Application** (4.5 points)
   - Calculate total area of all shapes
   - Find shape with largest/smallest area
   - Display information for each shape
   - Properly clean up dynamic memory

**Example Output**:
```
=== Shape Collection ===
Rectangle (5.0 x 3.0): Area = 15.00
Circle (radius 2.5): Area = 19.63
Rectangle (4.0 x 4.0): Area = 16.00

=== Statistics ===
Total area: 50.63
Largest shape: Circle (19.63)
Smallest shape: Rectangle (15.00)

[Cleanup] Destroying Rectangle
[Cleanup] Destroying Circle
[Cleanup] Destroying Rectangle
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Point Recovery
- This assignment is worth **50 points** of credit recovery for missed Chapter 2-5 work
- It does not replace the original assignments point-for-point -- see Canvas for how the recovered credit is applied to your grade
- You cannot earn full credit for chapters you skipped; the goal is to rebuild the foundation
- **Focus on learning, not just points**

### Moving Forward
- Complete this assignment ASAP
- Stay current with new assignments
- Don't fall behind again
- Use this as a foundation to catch up on concepts

### Academic Integrity
- Work must be your own
- Citing external references (cppreference, Stack Overflow, AI tools) is required
- No sharing solutions with other students
- Ask instructor if unclear about what's allowed

---

## 💪 Motivation

**You can do this!** This assignment is challenging but achievable:

- 4 hours of focused work (1 hour per chapter)
- Clear requirements and examples
- Course lecture notes and `quick-help.md` files available for each chapter
- Instructor support via Canvas discussion board and email

**The goal**: Get you back on track so you can succeed in this course. The concepts in Chapters 2-5 are foundational - understanding them will make everything else easier.

**Remember**: 50% recovery is better than 0%, and you'll learn essential C++ concepts that you need for the rest of the course.
